        <h1>SquareWarz</h1>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>This is a creature based sim where your creatures will breed passing their genetics onto their children.
            There
            isn't a goal per se, but this game is more about setting up and seeing how the creatures evolve.</p>
        <p>There are 3 different types of creatures:</p>
        <p>Humans: Yellow Squares. They are the smartest with their movement and will shoot from a distance. They have
            low
            birthrates (2 children per mating)</p>
        <p>Aliens: Small Purple Squares. They attack via melee. Aliens move fast and tend to rush enemies. They have
            high
            birthrates (3-4 children per mating) </p>
        <p>Zombies: Large Green Squares. They attack via melee. Zombies move slowly and reproduce by spreading their
            virus
            to an Alien or Human. Their bite has a small chance of infection. Once infected the affected creature will
            steadily lose health and die. Upon death the Square comes back as a Zombie and gets a roughly 50% boost to
            all
            their stats. On death, Zombies may send out goo that acts like a Zombie bite. There is a small chance the
            Zombie
            virus may ocassionally mutate and become beneficial to it's host and greatly boost stats. This is denoted by
            the
            creature flashing red. </p>
        <h2>Other Objects</h2>
        <p>Black Square: A solid wall, impassable</p>
        <p>Brown Circles: Food for Aliens and Humans, food does 3 things: increases strength, heals hp, and allows them
            to mate sooner.</p>
        <h2>Controls:</h2>
        <p>Space: Switch Selected Object/Creature</p>
        <p>Left Click: Place selected Object</p>
        <p>Right Click: Delete Object under Cursor</p>
        <p>P: pause and unpause the game. The game gets chaotic so this is a helpful option. You may still delete and
            add
            objects/creatures while the game is paused.</p>
