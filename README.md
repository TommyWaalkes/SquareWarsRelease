    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>This is a creature based sim where your creatures will breed passing their genetics onto their children. There
        isn't a goal per se, but this game is more about setting up and seeing how the creatures evolve.</p>
    <p>There are 3 different types of creatures:</p>
    <p>Humans: Yellow Squares. They are the smartest with their movement and will shoot from a distance. They have low
        birthrates (2 children per mating)</p>
    <p>Aliens: Small Purple Squares. They attack via melee. Aliens move fast and tend to rush enemies. They have high
        birthrates (3-4 children per mating) </p>
    <p>Zombies: Large Green Squares. They attack via melee. Zombies move slowly and reproduce by spreading their virus
        to an Alien or Human. Their bite has a small chance of infection. Once infected the affected creature will
        steadily lose health and die. Upon death the Square comes back as a Zombie and gets a roughly 50% boost to all
        their stats. On death, Zombies may send out goo that acts like a Zombie bite. There is a small chance the Zombie
        virus may ocassionally mutate and become beneficial to it's host and greatly boost stats. This is denoted by the
        creature flashing red. </p>
    <h2>Controls:</h2>
